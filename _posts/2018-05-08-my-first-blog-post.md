The cell conducts numerous workshops, seminars, events and interactive sessions with eminent entrepreneurs, thus, providing the students unparalleled exposure to the entrepreneurial world. It also provides the students a platform to work on the live projects from start-ups which adds a star to their work experience and boosts management expertise.
